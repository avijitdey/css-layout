		    	<b>The flag of Bangladesh was adopted on the 17th of January 1972 following the independence of Bangladesh. A similar flag was used during the war of liberation of Bangladesh (back then known as East Pakistan), which ended in 1971 but that previous version had a map of the country on the red dot. It was decided to remove this map to make it easier to reproduce the flag accurately. Since then, the proportion of the red dot, as well as the colors of the flag, have been codified and made part of a law on how to reproduce it. Its official name is ”the red and green”. </b>
